              <p>
                EdgeView is our flagship AI-powered sports platform, beginning with pickleball and 
                designed to expand across multiple sports. We're combining tournament management 
                with revolutionary AI capabilities including video analysis, automated coaching 
                insights, and performance analytics that were previously only available to

                Starting with the rapidly growing pickleball community, our platform addresses
